# Active Development Context

## Current Work

### Data Model & Storage Migration
- Completed full migration from local storage to PostgreSQL for core models.
- Enhanced migration scripts have been implemented:
  - Versioned up and down SQL files (e.g. 20250216_001_up.sql and 20250216_001_down.sql).
  - A new migration runner (scripts/migrate.js) now executes migrations in individual transactions with robust error handling, rollback, and detailed logging.
- The data migration script (scripts/migrateData.js) now supports dry-run mode and provides progress tracking.

### API Enhancements
- Extended API endpoints:
  - Factories API now supports full CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Created a new Worlds API endpoint to create and retrieve world records.
- Input validation, error handling, and response formatting have been improved across API routes.

### Frontend Integration
- The WorldForm component has been updated:
  - It now uses the new PostgreSQL-backed API endpoints.
  - Robust error and loading state handling have been integrated.
  - Optimistic UI updates ensure consistency between the frontend and backend.
  - A helper function (`parseGameDifficulty`) has been added to assist with type conversion.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
- Thoroughly test API endpoints and migration scripts.
- Expand CRUD functionality for the Worlds API (e.g., adding update and deletion support).
- Increase unit and integration test coverage for both backend and frontend elements.

### Upcoming Phases
- **Phase 3: API Layer Enhancement**  
  Further extend API endpoints for worlds and factories, including update and deletion support where missing, and integrate additional features as the application scales.

- **Phase 4: Frontend Integration**  
  Develop a centralized API service layer to streamline frontend interactions, enhance UI components based on user feedback, and improve error handling and performance metrics.

- **Phase 5: Testing & Validation**  
  Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for backend and frontend components, optimize performance, and further refine error handling and transaction management.

### Technical Debt & Planned Enhancements
- Develop a centralized API service layer for streamlined frontend integration and improved error handling.
- Optimize database queries and further refine transaction management.
- Continue enhancing the UI components based on user feedback and performance metrics.

## Recent Changes Summary
- Migration system enhanced with versioning and transaction safety.
- Comprehensive CRUD operations added to factories and worlds API routes.
- WorldForm component updated with improved UX, error handling, and loading indicators, along with helper functions to manage type consistency.
