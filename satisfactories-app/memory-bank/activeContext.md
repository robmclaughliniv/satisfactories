# Active Context

Current Focus:
- Completed implementation of generic CRUD functions for the PostgreSQL database in `src/services/db.ts`. The functions include:
  - `createRecord`: Inserts a new record using parameterized queries.
  - `getRecord`: Retrieves records based on provided conditions.
  - `updateRecord`: Updates records with new data based on conditions.
  - `deleteRecord`: Deletes records matching specified conditions.
  
- Comprehensive Jest tests in `src/services/db.test.ts` have been implemented and executed using a temporary test table to validate the CRUD operations.

Next Steps:
- Explore additional enhancements for the database layer and integrate further application features as needed.
