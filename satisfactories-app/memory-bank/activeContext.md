## Current Focus
PostgreSQL Integration via Connection Pooling

## PostgreSQL Integration Plan

1. **Dependency Update**
   - Add the "pg" package to package.json. This will enable PostgreSQL connectivity via the pg library.

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Update the .env (or .env.example) file with the necessary PostgreSQL connection parameters such as host, port, username, password, and database name (or a complete DATABASE_URL).
   - Ensure that these environment variables are loaded within the server application (using dotenv if not already set up).

3. **Implement Connection Pooling**
   - Modify `src/services/db.ts` to create a connection pool using `pg.Pool`.
   - Configure the pool to use the connection parameters from the environment.
   - Implement helper functions (e.g., a query function) that utilize the pool for executing SQL queries.
   - Ensure robust error handling and logging for potential connection issues.

4. **Test Database Connectivity**
   - Create a simple test query (e.g., `SELECT 1`) to verify that the database connection works correctly.
   - Optionally, expose a minimal API endpoint that can trigger this test to confirm that the server is able to communicate with PostgreSQL.

5. **Migrations Integration**
   - Review and adjust existing migration scripts (if necessary) so that they work smoothly with PostgreSQL and the new connection pool.
   - Ensure that schema migrations run correctly against the database.

6. **Verification and Documentation**
   - Document the changes in this file and other relevant documentation (e.g., README.md) to ensure future maintainers understand the new PostgreSQL setup.
   - Confirm the successful integration of PostgreSQL by testing basic read/write operations.

## Additional Notes
- Focus on using connection pooling for reliable and efficient database interactions.
- This plan serves as the guide for the upcoming modifications to ensure that our server-side application properly reads and writes to the PostgreSQL database.
