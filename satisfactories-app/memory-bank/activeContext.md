# Active Development Context

## Current Work

### Data Model & Storage Migration
1. **User Management**
   - Migrated user preferences and settings to PostgreSQL.
   - World collections are now managed in the PostgreSQL database.
   - Data migration from local storage to PostgreSQL has been implemented for core models, with ongoing testing for edge cases and rollback support.

2. **World Enhancements**
   - Enhanced world properties including game version tracking, difficulty settings, coordinate system, tagging, and power statistics.
   - The WorldForm component has been updated to interact with API endpoints that persist data in PostgreSQL.

3. **Factory Improvements**
   - Advanced factory features such as categorization, operational status, location tracking, power management, building counts, and efficiency tracking have been integrated.
   - The factories API now queries PostgreSQL to retrieve up-to-date data.

4. **Resource System**
   - Resource type definitions, purity levels, transport methods, rate calculations, and efficiency tracking have been migrated to PostgreSQL.
   - A dedicated resources table has been introduced and is managed via database migration scripts.

### Recent Changes
- Completed full migration from local storage to PostgreSQL for core data models.
- Updated the WorldForm component to use API endpoints for data persistence.
- Enhanced form interfaces, error handling, and UI responsiveness for desktop users.
- Deployment pipeline updated to include database migration steps.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Data Migration Testing**
   - Test the migration of existing world data.
   - Verify data integrity within PostgreSQL.
   - Address edge cases and implement robust rollback mechanisms.

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - Finalize integration of API-based data persistence in UI components.
   - Refine error handling and user feedback within forms.
   - Optimize the desktop UI performance and responsiveness.

3. **Feature Implementation**
   - Expand API endpoints to support complete CRUD functionality.
   - Strengthen server-side validation and security measures.
   - Enhance integration tests covering data flow between the UI and PostgreSQL.

### Technical Debt
- Increase comprehensive test coverage for migration and API endpoints.
- Implement detailed logging for migration processes and API errors.
- Update documentation to reflect new PostgreSQL workflows and architecture changes.
