# Project Brief: Satisfactories

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Satisfactories** is a web application designed to help Satisfactory players track and manage the details of their factory networks across multiple “worlds.” It consolidates all the crucial production data—inputs, outputs, power usage, and more—into one unified dashboard, reducing the need to switch between spreadsheets or external tools.

**Why It Matters**  
Satisfactory's complexity requires detailed oversight of resource chains and production processes. Satisfactories streamlines this task with a comprehensive, desktop-focused interface that facilitates efficient management and planning.

## 2. Project Goals

1. **Centralized Factory Management**  
   Provide a complete, desktop-optimized view of all factories, resources, and production metrics.

2. **Time & Effort Savings**  
   Replace disparate tools with a single, intuitive platform that consolidates all essential data.

3. **Desktop Optimization**  
   Deliver a robust interface designed for larger screens, enhancing data visualization and detailed management.

4. **Scalable & Future-Ready Architecture**  
   Build a foundation that supports future enhancements such as advanced analytics, real-time data integration, and collaborative management.

## 4. Technical Decisions

1. **Front End**  
   - **Next.js + TypeScript** (utilizing serverless SSR on AWS Lambda).
   - **Tailwind CSS** with **Flowbite** for a robust, desktop-first user interface.

2. **Data Persistence**  
   - Transition from local storage to a PostgreSQL database accessed via node-postgres.

3. **Performance & Testing**  
   - Employ code splitting, lazy loading, and rigorous accessibility standards.
   - Use Jest and Playwright for thorough testing of functionality and user interfaces.

4. **Deployment & Infrastructure**  
   - Deploy using AWS services (Lambda, CloudFront) alongside CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## 5. Implementation Approach

1. **MVP (Phase 1)**  
   - Develop initial interfaces using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
   - Integrate a PostgreSQL backend for robust data storage.

2. **Enhancements (Phase 2)**  
   - Implement advanced analytics and power consumption tracking.
   - Expand testing coverage and optimize performance.

3. **Advanced Features (Phase 3)**  
   - Add interactive mapping, real-time data features, and collaborative tools.
