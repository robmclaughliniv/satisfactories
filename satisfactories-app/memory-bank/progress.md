# Progress

## PostgreSQL Integration and Connection Pooling

- The PostgreSQL integration has been successfully implemented:
  - The "pg" dependency was added to package.json.
  - Environment configuration for the PostgreSQL connection is in place.
  - The connection pooling has been implemented in `src/services/db.ts` using `pg.Pool`, with robust error handling and a helper query function.
  
- A test script (`scripts/testDb.ts`) was created to verify connectivity by executing a simple query (`SELECT 1 AS result;`).

## Testing Script Execution Issues

- Installation of `ts-node` as a dev dependency allowed an attempt to run the TypeScript test script.
- Initial execution attempts using various commands (e.g., `npx ts-node`, `npx ts-node --esm`, `node --loader ts-node/esm`) resulted in errors related to unknown file extensions and ES module loader issues.
- An error regarding a require cycle (`ERR_REQUIRE_CYCLE_MODULE`) was encountered during execution.
- Efforts to modify the TypeScript module output (e.g., changing "module" configuration) were proposed but not implemented as the file update was declined.

## Next Steps

- Resolve ts-node execution issues related to ES module support and potential module cycles.
- Investigate configuration options either in `tsconfig.json` or modify the test script's module syntax to work seamlessly with ts-node.
- Once the test script issues are resolved, further verify read/write operations against the PostgreSQL database.

This progress update captures our current state, including successful connection pooling implementation and the challenges encountered with executing our TypeScript test script using ts-node.
