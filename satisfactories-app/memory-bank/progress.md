# Progress

Date: 2/17/2025

Recent Progress:
- Successfully added new migration files (20250217_001_up.sql and 20250217_001_down.sql) to extend the database schema with the users, worlds, factories, and resources tables.
- Updated the activeContext.md to reflect these changes.
- The migration script (satisfactories-app/scripts/migrate.js) is configured to execute these migrations.

Next Steps:
- Test the migration execution to ensure the database schema updates correctly.
- Integrate any necessary updates in the database service (src/services/db.ts) as needed.
