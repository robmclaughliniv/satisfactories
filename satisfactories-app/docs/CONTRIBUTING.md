   - Link any related issues
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

## Code Style Guide

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality. Our style guide is based on:

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Define explicit return types for functions
- Use interfaces over types when possible

### React

- Use functional components
- Implement proper prop types
- Use hooks according to [React Hooks guidelines](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
- Follow component naming conventions:
  ```typescript
  // Component files are PascalCase
  // components/MyComponent.tsx
  export function MyComponent({ prop1, prop2 }: MyComponentProps) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

### CSS/Tailwind

- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use semantic class names
- Maintain dark mode support

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies

Example:
```typescript
describe('WorldForm', () => {
  it('should validate required fields', () => {
    // Arrange
    render(<WorldForm />);
    
    // Act
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Create World'));
    
    // Assert
    expect(screen.getByText('World name is required')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### E2E Tests

- Cover critical user flows
- Test on multiple viewport sizes
- Include accessibility checks

## Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Document new features in USER_GUIDE.md
- Update API documentation
- Include JSDoc comments for public functions
- Add inline comments for complex logic

### Documentation Style

```typescript
/**
 * Updates a factory within a world
 * @param worldId - The ID of the world containing the factory
 * @param factory - The factory data to update
 * @throws {Error} If world is not found
 */
function updateFactory(worldId: string, factory: Factory): void {
  // Implementation
}
```
