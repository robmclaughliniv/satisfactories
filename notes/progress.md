   - All routes now use Prisma for database operations

### Previous Updates
1. Added Resource Node Support
- Modified ResourceForm component to include a source type selector for inputs
- Added 'factory' and 'resource-node' options
- Updated the form's state management and submission logic to handle resource nodes
- Modified the onAddInput type to include `isResourceNode` flag

2. Factory Filtering by World
- Updated factory fetching in factory detail page
- Modified API call to include worldId parameter: `/api/factories?worldId=${factoryData.worldId}`
- Ensures factories dropdown only shows factories from the same world

3. Item Dropdown Structure
- Updated game data API to return correct item structure
- Modified getAllGameItems to transform data to match ResourceForm expectations
- Simplified item selection UI by removing icon handling
- Current item structure returned by API:
```typescript
{
  id: string; // Using className as id
  name: string;
  description: string | null;
}
```

## Current Component States

### New Components
1. **NavBar**
   - Main navigation component with users, worlds, and factories tabs
   - Highlights active section

2. **UserSelectionModal**
   - Displays user cards with search functionality
   - Fetches users from the database
   - Opens WorldSelectionModal when a user is selected

3. **WorldSelectionModal**
   - Shows worlds for a selected user
   - Provides option to create new worlds
   - Includes "View All Worlds" link

4. **UserCard & SearchBar**
   - Reusable components for user display and filtering

### ResourceForm Component
- Handles both input and output resources
- Supports resource node as input source
- Current props interface:
```typescript
type ResourceFormProps = {
  items: Item[];
  factories: Factory[];
  onAddInput: (data: { 
    itemId: string; 
    rate: number; 
    factoryOriginId?: string; 
    isResourceNode?: boolean 
  }) => Promise<void>;
  onAddOutput: (data: { 
    itemId: string; 
    rate: number; 
    factoryDestinationId?: string 
  }) => Promise<void>;
  isLoading: boolean;
};
```

### Factory Detail Page
- Fetches and displays factory information
- Manages resource inputs/outputs
- Handles resource addition and deletion
- Filters factories by world
- Uses updated ResourceForm component

## Next Steps
1. Implement authentication to protect user data
2. Develop the factories section with database integration
3. Add more robust validation and error handling
4. Implement pagination for large datasets
5. Add editing and deleting functionality for users/worlds
6. Implement backend support for resource nodes
7. Add UI indicators for resource node inputs
8. Update resource list to show source type
9. Add validation for resource node inputs
10. Consider adding resource node location information

## Known Issues
None currently identified - recent changes have addressed:
- Item dropdown selection and submission
- Factory filtering by world
- Resource node source option
- User and world management with database integration
